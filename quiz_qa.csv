159) Identify the following biochemical cycles from their descriptions for 7.5 points each. On a global scale, evaporation exceeds precipitation over the oceans. The result is a net movement of water vapor, carried by winds, from the ocean to the land. The excess of precipitation over evaporation on land results in the formation of surface and groundwater systems that flow back to the sea, completing the major part of the cycle. On land, more than ninety percent of the vaporization is due to plant transpiration, which together with other types of evaporation is referred to as evapotranspiration.;water cycle
The reciprocal processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration are responsible for the major transformations and movements of this element. A seasonal pulse in atmospheric carbon dioxide is caused by decreased photosynthetic activity during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. On a global scale, the return of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by respiration closely balances its removal by photosynthesis. However, the burning of wood and fossil fuels adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.;carbon cycle
Most of this element cycling through food webs is taken up by plants in the form of nitrate. Most of this, in turn, comes from the nitrification of ammonium that results from the decomposition of organic material. The addition of this element from the atmosphere and its return via denitrification involve relatively small amounts compared to the local recycling that occurs in the soil or water.;nitrogen cycle
This element, which does not have an atmospheric component, tends to cycle locally. Generally, small losses from terrestrial systems caused by leaching are balanced by gains from the weathering of rocks. Often the element is cycled through food webs. Some is lost from the ecosystem because of chemical precipitation or through settling of detritus to the bottom.;phosphorous cycle
